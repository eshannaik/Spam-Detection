# Spam-Detection

#### This project was done on Google Colab.
#### The dataset for this project can be got from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#### The main objective of this project is to predict if an sms is a spam or not. 
#### The different models that have been used to try to predict this are -
    Long Short Term Memory
    Light GBM
    Naive Bayes
    K Nearest Neighbours

#### The different libraries that have been used are :
    Pandas
    Numpy
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn
    Sklearn
    Keras
    Wordcloud
    Re
    Natural Language Toolkit
    
#### The accuracies achieved for the different models are :
    Dummy Classifier : 86.546%
    LSTM : 86.547 %
    Light GBM : 97.937 %
    Naive Bayes : 96.413 %
    K Nearest Neighbours : 91.928 %
    
#### As we can see Light GBM has the highest accuracy which is 97.937%
